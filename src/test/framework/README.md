# Test Framework #
This package relies on the [Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest/) framework. 

It was last-tested with Google Test 1.7. Appropriate makefiles are included. 

To quickly get started:

```
$ pushd src/test/framework
$ git clone git@github.com:google/googletest.git
$ popd
```

Once an initial copy of google test is downloaded, "make tests" will automatically build and link appropriate objects.
