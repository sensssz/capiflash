#Prevent cxlflash from loading automatically if an eligible CAPI Accelerator (CXL) adapter is found
#This is needed typically during maintenance of multiple adapters, such as an adapter microcode
#update which updates all present CXL adapters.

#If this file is found in /etc/modprobe.d then the kernel will respect the blacklist setting until
#subsequent reboots occur. If an initramfs update is made while this file is present in /etc
#then the cxlflash driver will be disabled on boot, requiring a manual "modprobe" of the driver.
